# Describe the core architectural components of Azure
This the module where we will learn about Azure physical organization : datacenters, availability zones and regions.
And also Azure organizational structure (management Infrastructure) : resources, resource groups and subscriptions.

## What is MS Azure?
Azure is a MS cloud computing platform with ever expanding services with help in your business expanstion.
Azure provides IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS.

Many teams start exploring the cloud by moving their existing applications to virtual machines (VMs) that run in Azure. Migrating your existing apps to VMs is a good start, but the cloud is much more than a different place to run your VMs.

For example, Azure provides artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that dynamically grow to accommodate massive amounts of data. Azure services enable solutions that aren't feasible without the power of the cloud.

## Get started with Azure accounts
* To create and use Azure services, you need an Azure subscription.
* When you're working with your own applications and business needs, you need to create an Azure account, and a subscription will be created for you.
* After you've created an Azure account, you're free to create additional subscriptions. For example, your company might use a single Azure account for your business and separate subscriptions for development, marketing, and sales departments.
* After you've created an Azure subscription, you can start creating Azure resources within each subscription.

## Create an Azure account
You can create an azure account in three forms
* by signing up on the Azure website 
* through a Microsoft representative
* purchase Azure access through a Microsoft partner

## Core Architecture of Azure:
The core architectural components of Azure may be broken down into two main groupings: the physical infrastructure, and the management infrastructure.
## Physical Infrastructure:
Physical infrastructure starts with Azure datacenters.Theyâ€™re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

 Datacenters are grouped into Azure Regions or Azure Availability Zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for your business-critical workloads.
