# Azure Fundamentals
* Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals. 
* Azure services support everything from simple to complex. 
* Azure has simple web services for hosting your business presence in the cloud. Azure also supports running fully virtualized computers managing your custom software solutions. Azure provides a wealth of cloud-based services like remote storage, database hosting, and centralized account management. Azure also offers new capabilities like artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) focused services.
* ``` Whether you're interested in compute, networking, or storage services; learning about cloud security best practices; or exploring governance and management options, think of Azure Fundamentals as your curated guide to Azure.```

AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. This exam includes three knowledge domain areas:

1. Describe cloud concepts 
2. Describe Azure architecture and services	
3. Describe Azure management and governance

# 1) Describe Cloud Concepts
## Into to cloud computing.
### What is Cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the  delivery of computing services over the internet. These cloud computing include common IT infrastructure such as Virtual machines, storage, database hosting, and networking. And these also expand on offering services like IoT, ML and AI. 

Because cloud computing offers services over the internet, It doesn't have to constrained with infrastructure the same as traditional datacenter.
### What is Share responsibility model ?
To understand shared responsibility model first we need to understand how things are done at <ins>traditional datacenters.<ins>

* In traditional datacenters, The company is <u> Responsible</u> for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens. The IT department is responsible for maintaining all the infrastructure and software needed to keep the datacenter up and running. They’re also likely to be responsible for keeping all systems patched and on the correct version.

But, with shared responsibility model these <u>responsibilities </u> are shared between <u>cloud service provider and consumer.</u>

* Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider.
* At the same time, the consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud, The consumer is also responsible for access security, meaning you only give access to those who need it.

Then, for some things, the responsibility depends on the situation. If you’re using a cloud SQL database, the cloud provider would be responsible for maintaining the actual database. However, you’re still responsible for the data that gets ingested into the database. 

If you deployed a virtual machine and installed an SQL database on it, you’d be responsible for database patches and updates, as well as maintaining the data and information stored in the database
